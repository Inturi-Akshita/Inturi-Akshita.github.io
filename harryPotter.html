        <div class="col" align = "center" id = "harry"><p>The fictional universe of British author J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series of fantasy novels comprises two distinct societies: 
            the Wizarding World and the Muggle world. In the novels, the Muggle world is the world inhabited by the non-magical majority, with 
            which the Wizarding world exists coextensively, albeit mostly remaining hidden from the non-magical humans.  They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger 
            readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.</p></div>

<p>  The plot of the series is set in 1990s Britain, but in a veiled and separate shadow society wherein magic is commonly used and practised, 
    and those who can use it live in self-enforced seclusion, hiding their abilities from the rest of the world.The term "Wizarding World" refers to the global 
    wizard community that lives hidden in parallel with the Muggle world; the different terms refer to different communities within the same 
    area rather than separate planets or worlds.</p>
